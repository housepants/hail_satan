# #hail_satan

A Google Chrome extension to remove annoying hashtags from the Facebook (news feed, user timelines, and comments) and replace them with "#hailsatan".

The code uploaded to this repository has been taken from a Facebook Hashtag remover (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-hashtag-remover/ajmbafmlojclfadlpmifhdhkkefknmlj?hl=en)
I figure all we need to do is add some script at the end that adds the "#hailsatan" after removing the initial hashtag.

If we could get this onto the Google Chrome store that'd be terrific, but one thing at a time.
